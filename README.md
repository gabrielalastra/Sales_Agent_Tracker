  <h2>Sales Analytics</h2>
  
  <p>The Wizard Mart have expanded into the USA and their busniss model involves placing Sales Agents in every state in the USA. These sales agents are responsible for briging in sales for the state that they are assigned to.
  <p>The Sales Manager wants a dashboard to track how Sales Agents are doing. He wants it to be comparable where he selects a timeframe this year (Ex. Jan - March 2021) and he wants sales data for the same period last year.
  <p>Additionally, he wants a breakdown of sales per category and subcategory as well as the top performing products.
